Solidity Smart Contract

Welcome to my Solidity Smart Contracts Portfolio! This repository showcases essential Solidity concepts through practical examples. Whether you're new to blockchain development or looking to sharpen your skills, these examples provide a solid foundation in Ethereum smart contract development.

📝 Introduction

Explore the core building blocks of Solidity with these straightforward examples. Each contract demonstrates fundamental concepts, offering a solid foundation for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

🚀 Features

This project covers the following key concepts in Solidity:

- State Variables & Data Types: Understand how to declare and use state variables with different data types like uint, string, address, and more.
- Functions (Store & Retrieve): Learn how to create functions that interact with state variables, allowing you to store and retrieve data on the blockchain.
- Arrays & Mappings: Explore structured data storage with arrays and mappings, essential tools for managing collections of data in Solidity.
- Deploying Contracts from Contracts: See how a contract can deploy another contract, demonstrating advanced techniques for contract interaction and modular design.
- Inheritance, Override, & Virtual: Dive into Solidity’s object-oriented features with inheritance. Understand how to reuse code across contracts and customize functionality with override and virtual keywords.
